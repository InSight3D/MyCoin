### About MyCoin

  MyCoin is an Open Source application, which offers users both, a free-to-use mock crypto exchange as well as a Web3 Academy, which would teach critical skills for investing in the crypto space and how to interact with the Blockchain. We want to create a place where users can safely learn to invest without the risk of losing their hard-earned assets. To facilitate safe learning, the MyCoin trading function will grant users $10,000 in paper currency to use on the platform. In addition, MyCoin will also offer an Academy where users can learn trading strategies and web development. The combination of educational materials and a no-risk platform on which to apply them is central to our mission of providing essential knowledge and skills education in the space at no charge. The more users know, the safer Web3 will be. Though the basics and essentials will not be behind a paywall, users who elect to continue learning about the space can pay a small subscription (ex: $10/month), which will support the platform and its mission and unlock extra features in both the Trading and Academy spaces.
